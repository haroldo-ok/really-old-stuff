       Super Majik Spiral Crew's Guide to the Sega Master System (0.02)
==============================================================================

Introduction -
--------------

This manual is made up of information gathered from a document written by a
person named Jon which was last updated 11/23/93, and a document released by
Andrew Lindsay of the Sega Master System Preservation Society on 03/03/97
"http://members.aol.com/smsstuff".  Newest additions to the document are from
e-mail conversations with James McKay, the author the best Master System
emulator around, Massage, which we use to do all our testing,
"http://http://www.users.dircon.co.uk/~dmckay/massage.html".  I also found
an other small document on programming the Game Gear by Charles Doty from
"http://www.yab.com/~cdoty/console.html", but most of the information appears
to be incorrect (or just different on the Game Gear than the Master System),
but he did have some working code that I modified to work with the Master
System, and did learn a few things from.

Apparently at some time there were indie programmers working on the Sega
Master System (SMS) and Game Gear (GG), but now from all my searches on the
Internet it seems they have all but disappeared.  These programmers must have
had much more knowledge about the SMS than I have been able to recover if it
was possible for them to write the games, and from what I have gathered from
the document by Jon, actually test their games on the hardware.  Actually now
as a correction to the above statement, I have recovered what I feel is all
that is needed to write games, it is just a matter of putting the code
together and figuring out a few small settings.  Although I am no closer to
being able to test code on the actual SMS.

It is the goal of the Super Majik Spiral Crew (SMSC) to revive this lost
information first through testing on emulators and finally being able to burn
EPROM based carts to run on the actual hardware.

Oh, do to mood swings and other untrackable reasons there are a number of
different ways used to refer to Decimal, Hexadecimal, and Binary numbers.

Decimal are either by them seleves or refered to dirrectly as decimal in the
text.

Hexadecimal are either preceded by a "$" or "0x", or followed by an "h".

Binary are always followed by a "b" as far as I can remember.

If you have any additional information, corrections, or find anything unclear
about this document please write to cmeadors@stu.ac.cc.md.us and we'll get you
fixed right up.

Basic Hardware -
----------------

The SMS is an 8 bit video game system based around Zilog's Z80 CPU.  The SMS
has a cartridge slot for games from 128k to 512k and a card slot for credit
card sized games which are 32k.  Amazing new info from James, he reports that
Massage has support for 256 16k banks of data in a cartridge which would allow
4096k (32 megabit) games.  He believes that the orginal SMS may have also had
this ability.  So, why were there no games bigger than 512k?  If you remember
what a 4 Mega game cost (70$US), a 8 Mega game would have run almost double
that.  By the time the cost of game parts came down, the 16 bit systems had
taken the field.  Oh, to see what a 32 Mega game could have been...perhaps one
day through SMCS we will.


Basic Video -
-------------

The SMS uses a character-mapped screen.  The internal size of the is 32x28
characters, while actual the displayed size is variable.  The character are
8x8 in size, and are used both on screen, and as sprites.  The characters are
made up of 4 bit planes, allowing for 16 colors.  There are two user definable
palettes of 16 colors each, one for the characters displayed on the screen,
and the other for the sprites, this arangement can make for some interesting
effects with dual palette rotation.  The range of colors available for use in
the palette is 64, or 6-bit color, or 2-bits per each red, green, and blue
value.

Up to 448 characters can be defined, arranged as one set of 256, and another
set of 192.  There can be 64 hardware controled sprites on screen at one time,
which can be picked from either of the two sets of characters.  Generally the
sprites are just 8x8 chacters, but there is a video register setting that
allows for 8x16 sprites made from 2 characters, this is explained more in the
detailed video section.

Characters printed on the screen may be flipped in either x or y, or both
dirrections, and additionally can be forced infront or behind sprites.
Sprites cannot use the flipped characters, which Jon considered a major
omission, for which he wanted to see someone hurt, I have yet to deturmin
myself how I feel, but am sure to agree with him.  Basicly flipped characters
in sprites would have let you make a character in a game walk in either
dirrection without having to waste two sets of characters.

Hardware scrolling is supported on both the x and y axis, but from what I have
found so far, it seems to only be in a positive dirrection.  But playing
almost any game shows the scrolling in both dirrections is possible, but may
not be done in hardware.  Another problem I have found with the scrolling is
that the internal screen is the same size (or maybe only 1 pixel larger) as
the displayed screen, so getting a smooth scroll with out character popup at
the boarders may be a bit of work.  Only time will tell.

All access to the screen, sprite, character set, and assorted video registers
is done via ports.  Access to certain parts of video RAM is only reliable
either on the vertical retrace, or when the screen is switched off.  Again Jon
is annoyed by this, but not surprised.

Basic Sound -
-------------

The SMS has a 3 channel tone generator, along with a white noise channel, and
is mono.  The Japanese Master System called the Mark III also had an FM sound
chip which is included in some emulations of the SMS.  I have no documentation
on the FM chip, but am sure someone out there does.  The standard sound chip
is stated to be much the same as the chips used in the Spectrums and Atari STs
so I'll be looking for more documentation on those systems to fill in some
blanks I have about usage of the SMS chip.  James has provided some basic info
on the FM chip, I know the part name, and Yamaha has a fax back service where
I can get the tech guide to the chip, so I'll be doing that soon.  Yamaha's
fax back service is junk!  I'll have to try to get the information some other
way.

Joysticks -
-----------

The SMS has 2 joystick ports, with capability for a lightgun.  I have
absolutely no documentation on the lightgun, and no emulators have support for
it, so it will be avoided for now.  The joystick is the standard 4 direction
with 2 fire buttons.  Also readable from the joystick ports is the Reset
button which was located on the console.  Next to the Reset button on the
console was the Pause button, but it is not handled on the joystick port.

Reading the joysticks is very easy, save for the fact that many of the devices
interfaced with the Z80 favored Active Low Logic, and the joysticks are no
different.  Active Low Logic simply means that 0 is pressed and 1 is released.

To read from a joystick port you just issuse the the command for the Z80 to
take input from a port.

The port layout looks like this:

Port $DC
        Bit 0   Joystick 1 Up
        Bit 1   Joystick 1 Down
        Bit 2   Joystick 1 Left
        Bit 3   Joystick 1 Right
        Bit 4   Joystick 1 Button 1
        Bit 5   Joystick 1 Button 2
        Bit 6   Joystick 2 Up
        Bit 7   Joystick 2 Down

Port $DD
        Bit 0   Joystick 2 Left
        Bit 1   Joystick 2 Right
        Bit 2   Joystick 2 Button 1
        Bit 3   Joystick 2 Button 2
        Bit 4   Reset Button
        Bit 5   Unused
        Bit 6   Lightgun Sync 1
        Bit 7   Lightgun Sync 2

It is noted that some games seem to write to ports $DE and $DF, but the reason
is yet unknown.

Pause Button -
--------------

The Pause button on the SMS is not readable.  Instead when pressed, a NMI is
generated forcing the processor to push the PC register to the stack, and jump
to offset 0066h.  At 0066h the program usually pushes AF, performs some tests
on a memory location, perhaps to see if the game is running, and then restores
the AF register and Returns from the NMI.  After a bit of investigation, and a
short conversation with James I have the complete skinny on the Pause Button.
The pause button does nothing other than what is stated above.  So how does it
pause a game?  How do you keep a game from pausing the title screen?  How do
you included Easter Eggs that use the pause button?  Simple, you code them.
As stated when the pause button is pressed, the program jumps to 0066h.  At
that location you have to include code that changes something in the user RAM
that the program can test to see if the game should be paused.  Because the
system does nothing different on pause and unpause, you probally should just
complement a the value in RAM, so it flops back and forth with the pause.  The
test probally should be done in your vertical blank routine so the pause is
checked often.  If the test is passed, you should turn off all the sound
channels (so you don't hold the last note played the whole time the game is
paused), and then just go into a loop the keeps checking the pause status and
exit the loop when the game is no longer paused.

Ports -
-------

$3F - Language detect?
$DC - Joystick
$DD - Joystick
$DE - Unknown
$DF - Unknown
$7E - Sound
$7F - Sound
$BE - Video data
$BF - Video registers
$F0 - FM Sound register
$F1 - FM Sound data
$F2 - FM Sound detect


Detailed Sound -
----------------

As mentioned before the sound chip is capable of generating 3 tones
simultaneously, each with individually selectable frequency and volume.
Additionally it can generate white noise, with user definable "type" and
volume.  The sound chip can be accessed via ports $7E and $7F, with no
discernable difference.  Though from this point on, $7F will always be used
as the sound port.  

With 10 bits for frequency there are 1024 steps avaible.  Unknown is what the
starting frequency is, what the ending frequency is, and how wide the steps
are.  Also unknown is if the frequency uses active low or active high logic.
Though the volume uses active low, it can be assumed that the high frequency
will be all 0s and the low frequency will be all 1s.

To set the frequency of one of the tone channels you must write two bytes to
the port:

Byte 1
        Bit 0   \
        Bit 1    | 4 least significant bits
        Bit 2    | of the frequency
        Bit 3   /

        Bit 4   \  000 = Channel 1
        Bit 5    | 010 = Channel 2
        Bit 6   /  100 = Channel 3

        Bit 7   1

Byte 2
        Bit 0   \
        Bit 1    |
        Bit 2    | 6 most significat bits
        Bit 3    | of the frequency
        Bit 4    |
        Bit 5   /

        Bit 6   Unused
        Bit 7   Unused

All other sound settings only require 1 byte to be written to the port.

With only 4 bits for volume that means there are only 16 steps avaible.  The
lowest volume is off, and the highest is on, so the steps looking something
like 0%, 7%, 13%, 20%, 27%, 33%, 40%, 47%, 53%, 60%, 67%, 73%, 80%, 87%, 93%,
and 100%.  Actually you'd be quite amazed how smooth a volume fade can sound
even with only 16 steps.

To change the volume of one of the tone channels write the following byte to
the port:

Byte 1
        Bit 0   \
        Bit 1    | 4 bits to define volume
        Bit 2    | 0000 = loudest, 1111 = off
        Bit 3   /

        Bit 4   \  001 = Channel 1
        Bit 5    | 011 = Channel 2
        Bit 6   /  101 = Channel 3

        Bit 7   1

With 3 bits for the noise type there are 8 possibilities for different noise
types, what is unknown is what exactly these noise types are.  Even if we can
get some working code to listen to the noise on a emulated system, it still
may not tell us much because none of the emulators do the noise channel right
yet.

To change the type of noise, write the following byte to the port:

Byte 1
        Bit 0   \  3 bits to define
        Bit 1    | noise type 0-7
        Bit 2   /

        Bit 3   Unused

        Bit 4   0
        Bit 5   1
        Bit 6   1
        Bit 7   1

Here is a bit of information from James on the noise channel of the SMS, along
with a note or two about how it is emulated by Massage:

Bit 2:
White noise=1, Synchronous noise=0.

Bit 1,0:

Bin  Frequency
--------------
00 : Clock/16
01 : Clock/32
10 : Clock/64
11 : Frequency is taken from tone generator 3.

Note : Clock is 110Khz.

White noise is the only setting that is emulated, and all 8 are exactly the 
same on the Adlib card, since it doesn't allow you to change the frequency of 
the snare drum.

Synchronous noise is described in the official manual as "a 6.25% duty pulse 
waveform", but I don't think I've seen anything that actually used it.

Again the same 16 volume steps apply to the noise channel.  Actually this
description probally could have been included with the tone channels, as the
only thing that is different is the channel specification bits.

To change the volume of the noise channel write the following byte to the
port:

Byte 1
        Bit 0   \
        Bit 1    | 4 bits to define volume
        Bit 2    | 0000 = loudest, 1111 = off
        Bit 3   /

        Bit 4   1
        Bit 5   1
        Bit 6   1
        Bit 7   1

I'm going to do a brief run down of the byte formation for the different
sound chip settings, so you can see how the different setting relate, and
perhaps get some ideas on how to code them.


                    | Byte 1 | Byte 2 | Byte 1 |    Byte 2
      Setting       |76543210|76543210|  Hex   |      Hex
--------------------|--------|--------|--------|---------------
Channel 1 Frequency |1000xxxx|11xxyyyy|8x x=0-F|xy x=C-F, y=0-F
Channel 1 Volume    |1001xxxx|nnnnnnnn|9x x=0-F|Unused
Channel 2 Frequency |1010xxxx|11xxyyyy|Ax x=0-F|xy x=C-F, y=0-F
Channel 2 Volume    |1011xxxx|nnnnnnnn|Bx x=0-F|Unused
Channel 3 Frequency |1100xxxx|11xxyyyy|Cx x=0-F|xy x=C-F, y=0-F
Channel 3 Volume    |1101xxxx|nnnnnnnn|Dx x=0-F|Unused
Noise Channel Type  |1110nxxx|nnnnnnnn|Ex x=0-7|Unused
Noise Channel Volume|1111xxxx|nnnnnnnn|Fx x=0-F|Unused

x = Varible, y= Varible, n = Not Used

In the case of a not used bit in the first byte I'd set it to 0 for ease of
math, but in the case of the second byte, if all bits aren't used, you just
don't write that byte cause it isn't required, and if you did write it funny
things would start coming out of the speaker, actually if you write all 0s
probally nothing would happen, as that isn't a valid command.

To use FM chip on the Mark III:
(Port info from James, data format from SCCOPLL.TXT from Marat's MSX page)

I/O port $F0    FM chip register address.
         $F1    FM chip data address.
         $F2    Use to detect the presence of the FM chip (not sure how).

1 clock cycle needed after writing to $F0.
7 clock cycles wait needed after writing $F1.
(use NOPs or do something else with your time)

Mark III FM registers:

There is still much missing data on the FM chip, but this is a start.

Detailed Video -
----------------

The video chip also uses two ports, but unlike the sound chip the two ports in
this case do different things.  There is an address port $BF, and the other
is the data port $BE.  Before writing to, or reading from video RAM it is
necessary to set the video address.  This is accomplished by writing the low
byte and then the high byte of the address to port $BF.

The actual amount of video RAM is questionable.  I would be think that 64k
would be a good guess except for the way the registers are used, it could be
that the registers are in video memory (a very good chance) but just are used
differently.

Well anyway, here is the Video RAM map as best as I can figure:

Bytes   Area            Notes

8k      0000h-1FFFh     The first 256 characters can be read from here.

6k      2FFFh-37FFh     The last 192 character definations read from here.

1.5k    3800h-3DFFh     Screen memory, can read from here to find out what
                        character is in what location on the screen.

256     3E00h-3EFFh     Alternate read area for the sprite table?

64      3F00h-3F3Fh     Read area for the sprite table, contains the 64 sprite
                        Y coordinates.

64      3F80h-3F7Fh     64 unused bytes, read as you will.

128     3F80h-3FFFh     64 (sprite X coord, sprite character) pairs can be
                        read from here.

16      C010h-C01Fh     Sprite color palette, also explained later.

?       C020h-?         Unknown.  Totally Unknown!

One thing that I find very nice is that writing to the data port causes the
video address to auto-increment, so large blocks of data may be written once
the initial video address is set.  Extra nice about this is the Z80 has plenty
of auto-incrementing and repeating commands for coping data from one place to
another.  Reading from video RAM is also possible, although Jon's document
says to ignore the first byte read from the data port, this reason for this
is unknown, and I am interested in what that first byte contains.  Again the
video address will auto-increment after each read.

Accessing any video RAM should be restricted to either the vertical retrace
period, or when the screen is switched off.  During the vertical retrace it is
estimated that you can write 384 bytes which is enough to redefine 12
characters, definatly enough to change both color palettes, or change the
location of all the sprites on screen.

As mentioned before going along with the video RAM, there are also a number of
registers, which have different effects on the display.  Jon's document says
that these registers are Write-Only.  To set a register you just write the
value of the byte to be set to the video address port $BF, followed by the
number of the register to the same port.  This is the same as setting the
address when doing a data write, but in this case there is nothing written to
the data port, and the effect of setting the address port is seen right away.
So even though the registers seem to reside in the video RAM them seem to be
handled totally differenly by the system.  Also because there is no real
access to video RAM the registers can be set at any time, so some special
effects can be managed.

The following Register descriptions are taken almost dirrectly from Jon's doc,
as I didn't feel like retyping most of this.  Some changes have been made for
clarity, and to remove references to the Game Gear as that is not the focus of
my document.  So for the next part here, "I" refers to Jon.

Register 80h
        Bit 0   Screen sync off
        Bit 1   Normal or enable stretch screen
        Bit 2   Causes graphics change (related to screen addr?)
        Bit 3   Shift sprites left by 1 character
        Bit 4   Horizontal interupts enable
        Bit 5   Display extra column on LHS of screen
        Bit 6   Top 2 rows of screen horizontal non-scrolling (Master System)
        Bit 7   Right side of screen vertical non-scrolling (Master System)

The stretch screen option is really isn't too useful.  Make of bit 2 what you
will, but you'll probably find that you should set it anyway.  Likewise with
bit 5.  Bits 6 will give you a two character high panel at the top of the
screen that is unaffected by the horizontal scroll.  Bit 7 will give you a
wide panel on the right hand side of the screen that is unaffected by the
vertical scroll.  Info on Bit 4 was provided by James McKay, but he warns that
the H interrupts are the most inaccurate parts of the emulator, don't expect 
there to be any more beyond line 191 (although there is).


Register 81h
        Bit 0   Double sized pixels in sprites
        Bit 1   8x16 sprites
        Bit 2   0?
        Bit 3   Stretch screen by 6 rows (Master System)
        Bit 4   Stretch screen by 4 rows (Master System)
        Bit 5   Vertical interrupts enable
        Bit 6   Screen enable
        Bit 7   0?

Bit 0 causes all pixels in sprites to double in size, so that each 8x8
character sprite takes up 16x16 pixels.  Alas this applies to ALL sprites, so
its usefulness it doubtful.  Bit 1 allows you to use 8x16 sprites, which IS
useful.  Instead of just one 8x8 appearing at each sprite coordinate, the
character immediately after the desired one will appear directly below the
original sprite.  Using this mode does limit you to using even character
numbers only.  Stretching the screen by 6 rows is not recommended, as it does
not appear to be a supported mode on the convertor on the Mega-Drive, one can
only assume that this mode is not officially acknowledged by Sega.  I am given
to understand that stretching the screen by 4 rows will work on a convertor,
but with any stretched screen mode you have less characters.

You must set bit 5 and put the Z80 in interrupt mode 1 with interrupts enabled
in order to get interrupts on the vertical retrace. If you disable the screen
by clearing bit 6 you can have unlimited access to video RAM.  James also
corrects that Bit 5 is only for Vertical Interupts, not just general screen
interupts.  The SMS generates one V interupt for every screen field, on the
interlaced TVs of the world there are two fields for every full frame.  That
translates into 60 V blanks per second on NTSC and 50 on PAL (I guess also
SECAM, but who cares about the French).  Using the V blank for timing will
make games run slower on European systems, but that is usually the way it is
done.  Emulation Note:  Massage emulates a PAL SMS, so the speed should be set
to 117% for 60 V blanks a second.

Register 82h
        Bit 0   0?
        Bit 1   \
        Bit 2    | Address of screen in video RAM
        Bit 3   /
        Bit 4   0?
        Bit 5   0?
        Bit 6   0?
        Bit 7   0?

Bits 1,2,3 control the address of the screen in video memory.  The screen is
1.5k in size, and can apparently be moved.  Setting this register to 0Eh gives
us the screen at 7800h, which seems pretty sensible to me.  I have no idea
what the other bits do, if anything.

Register 83h
        Bit 0   1?
        Bit 1   1?
        Bit 2   1?
        Bit 3   1?
        Bit 4   1?
        Bit 5   1?
        Bit 6   1?
        Bit 7   1?

This register is a complete mystery.  However, setting it to FFh seems to have
no adverse side effects at the moment.

Register 84h
        Bit 0   1?
        Bit 1   1?
        Bit 2   1?
        Bit 3   1?
        Bit 4   1?
        Bit 5   1?
        Bit 6   1?
        Bit 7   1?

I'm sure this register is related to 83h. Again for safety I set it to FFh.
By messing with registers 83h and 84h and setting or clearing unknown bits in
other registers I have had a sort-of bitmap mode, although I have had no luck
in finding any sensible way to control it.  Oh, for the official spec!! What
interesting and enlightening reading that would be....

Register 85h
        Bit 0   1
        Bit 1   \
        Bit 2    |
        Bit 3    | Address of sprite table in video RAM
        Bit 4    |
        Bit 5    |
        Bit 6   /
        Bit 7   1

This register controls the address of the sprite table in video memory.
Usually this is set to 7Fh, so that the table is at 7F00h, but writing
alternate values will alter the address of the sprite table accordingly.

James Corrects:
Bits 6-1 represent A13-A8, bit 7 and bit 0 are set to 1, so:

Data 0x81 Base 0x0000
Data 0xFF Base 0x3F00


Register 86h
        Bit 0   0?
        Bit 1   0?
        Bit 2   Controls which set of characters is used for sprites
        Bit 3   0?
        Bit 4   0?
        Bit 5   0?
        Bit 6   0?
        Bit 7   0?

Writing 0 to bit 2 allows you to use the set of 256 characters as sprites,
writing 1 allows you to use the set of 192 characters as sprites.  The other
bits don't seem to have an effect, although I could be wrong..

Register 87h
        Bit 0   \
        Bit 1    | Border color [0..15] from sprite palette
        Bit 2    |
        Bit 3   /
        Bit 4   0?
        Bit 5   0?
        Bit 6   0?
        Bit 7   0?

Bits 0-3 control the border color, which is taken from the sprite palette.
Bits 4-7 seemingly have no use.

Register 88h
        Bit 0   \
        Bit 1    |
        Bit 2    |
        Bit 3    | Horizontal scroll
        Bit 4    |
        Bit 5    |
        Bit 6    |
        Bit 7   /

This register controls the horizontal scrolling.  You may write a value from
0 to 255, and the screen display will be affected immediately.  You can write
to this at different times during the display period to get raster splits.

Register 89h
        Bit 0   \
        Bit 1    |
        Bit 2    |
        Bit 3    | Vertical scroll
        Bit 4    |
        Bit 5    |
        Bit 6    |
        Bit 7   /

This register controls the vertical scrolling.  Values from 0 to 223 are
valid.  Again you can write to it any time you fancy.

Register 8Ah
        Bit 0   \
        Bit 1    |
        Bit 2    |
        Bit 3    | No of pixels apart you want interrupts
        Bit 4    |
        Bit 5    |
        Bit 6    | 
        Bit 7   /

You can generate interrupts on any given raster line with a bit of effort.  If
you just want an interrupt on the vertical blank period then write FFh to this
register and we'll say no more about it.  However, the adventurous amongst you
may like to write a number between 0 and 127 to this port.  This will generate
an interrupt that number of pixels apart.  So, it's then quite easy to get a
rock solid raster-split.  Firstly write FFh to the register, when you get the
interrupt on the vertical blank write a different number to the register.
When you get that interrupt alter the x-scroll or whatever, and then write FFh
to the register to make sure you get the next interrupt on the vertical blank.
Yes, it's a little bit of a hassle, but it will work!

Thank you Jon!  In the future as I get more things working, I will attemt to
clarify, verify, and uncover as much as I can about these registers myself.


Character Data Format -
-----------------------

The characters on the SMS are made from 4 bit planes allowing for 16 colors
per pixel.

To keep this description short I will only be explaining one row of a
character, remember when building actual characters you need 8 rows.

There are 4 bytes per row, one for each plane.  Bit 7 is for pixel 1, and Bit
0 is for pixel 8.  This may seem a bit strange, but if you look at how it
works for a second it makes a lot of sense.  If you take the total of the 4
bits in one position, that will give you the color of that pixel.

Example 1 (16 color):

FEDC3210

Each value above stands for one pixel in a row, that 4 bytes you would write
would be:

Plane 1:  1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 = AA
Plane 2:  1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 = CC
Plane 3:  1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 = F0
Plane 4:  1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 = F0
         -----------------
          F E D C 3 2 1 0

Thus, writing AAh, CCh, F0h, and F0h to the data port would set one row of a
charater to those colors.

Example 2 (8 color):

76543210

Plane 1:  1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 = AA
Plane 2:  1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 = CC
Plane 3:  1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 = F0
Plane 4:  0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 = 00
         -----------------
          7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0

Thus, writing AAh, CCh, F0h, and 00h to the data port would set one row of a
charater to those colors.  The last byte will always be 00h if you aren't
using colors above 7.  So you can set up code to load 8 color characters and
save 1 byte of storage per line of each character.

Example 3 (4 color):

32103210

Plane 1:  1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 = AA
Plane 2:  1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 = CC
Plane 3:  0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 = 00
Plane 4:  0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 = 00
         -----------------
          3 2 1 0 3 2 1 0

Thus, writing AAh, CCh, 00h, and 00h to the data port would set one row of a
charater to those colors.  The last two bytes will always be 00h if you aren't
using colors above 3.  So you can set up code to load 4 color characters and
save 2 bytes of storage per line of each character.

Example 4 (2 color):

10101010

Plane 1:  1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 = AA
Plane 2:  0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 = 00
Plane 3:  0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 = 00
Plane 4:  0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 = 00
         -----------------
          3 2 1 0 3 2 1 0

Thus, writing AAh, 00h, 00h, and 00h to the data port would set one row of a
charater to those colors.  The last three bytes will always be 00h if you
aren't using colors above 1.  So you can set up code to load 2 color
characters and save 3 bytes of storage per line of each character.  Really
only 2 and 16 color characters are the most useful, but seeing things
explained will give you the best grasp on how the SMS stores characters.

Character Displaying -
----------------------

Writing to the screen is very simple, if a little slow.  Firstly set the video
address to point to the part of the screen you wish to write to, defaulting
from 7800h to 7DFFh, which if you notice is 1536 bytes, which is 64x24, which,
lastly, is 32 characters across with two bytes to define them (as explained
next) and 24 characters down.  As mentioned before stretching the screen isn't
that good of an idea, cause the screen gets more rows, but you don't have any
more video RAM to map the characters to.  The second byte is the status byte
defined as followed:

        Bit 0   Write 0 to use low 255 chars, 1 to use top 192
        Bit 1   X-flip character
        Bit 2   Y-flip character
        Bit 3   Printed on foreground color
        Bit 4   0 = print behind sprites, 1 = print infront of sprites
        Bit 5   \
        Bit 6    | Unknown
        Bit 7   /

Palette Details -
-----------------

The SMS has a total of 64 colors, from which you can choose 16 for the
characters (video RAM C000h-C00Fh), and a second 16 for the sprites (video RAM
C010h-C01Fh).  What is unknown is how to get a tranparent color for use on
sprites so they don't have to be made from 8x8 solid squares.  My guess would
be that the transparent color is either palette entry 0 or 15.  Also unknow is
if the screen characters can also have transparent parts, I would think not.
Each color is defined as a byte:

        Bit 0   \ Red value
        Bit 1   / 0-3

        Bit 2   \ Green value
        Bit 3   / 0-3

        Bit 4   \ Blue value
        Bit 5   / 0-3

        Bit 6   Unused/Unknown
        Bit 7   Unused/Unknown

System Memory Map-
------------------

This is James' reply to a question I asked about memory paging and how to load
a game larger than 32k.  What he gave in return was a great deal of insight
into the SMS memory map.  The actual map was edited a bit by me to match the
layout that has been used so far in the document.

Bytes   Area            Notes

1k      0000h-03FFh     First 1k of ROM always, not swapped with Page 0
                        (not properly emulated by Massage, see below)

15k     0400h-3FFFh     Page 0

16k     4000h-7FFFh     Page 1

16k     8000h-BFFFh     Page 2 or Batery Backed RAM

8k      C000h-DFFFh     User RAM

8176    E000h-FFEFh     Mirror of most of the 8k user RAM
                        (but isn't complete and is reserved and shouldn't
                        be used).

16      FFF0h-FFFFh     Reserved for banking/future expansion

By default Page 0 is bank 0, and Page 1 is bank 1 within the emulator, giving 
you the first 32k.  So cards (32k) games don't need to set paging information.

0xFFFC:
Battery backed ram:
bit 7-4 - no known function.
bit 3: 16K RAM or ROM at Page 2. (0=ROM, 1=RAM).
bit 2: Which 16k page (0=first, 1=second).
bit 1-0 - no known function.

If RAM is paged in, then it has priority over the ROM, until the RAM is paged 
out again.

For the following, all values poked are ANDed (within the emulator) to keep 
them within the legal range of banks, so make the rom length a power of two, 
ie:

64k.
128k.
256k.
512k.

Also 384K which is a special case.  Technically Massage could also handle 
files of 1024K, 2048K and 4096K, but this has never been tried, and it is not 
known if a real sms could do it.  It would be interesting though...

If you want bank X, then poke X into one of the following addresses, simple 
as that.  Bank X starts at offset (X*16384) in the rom file.

0xFFFD:
Selects bank to go into Page 0.
NOTE : Only 15k from 0x0400 to 0x3FFF.

The reason for this is that you cannot be sure on power up which banks are 
in, so the first 1k is always locked to the first 1k of bank 0.  Even worse, 
Massage doesn't emulate this and will swap the whole 16k, I haven't seen any 
game which uses this, so I've got away with it so far.  If you do intend to 
use this make sure that you take this into consideraton.

0xFFFE:
Selects bank to go into Page 1.  All 16k.

0xFFFF:
Selects bank to go into Page 2.  All 16k.

So, you have 48K of ROM accessable at a time, followed by 8K of RAM.

0xFFFC to 0xFFFF can also be read, so that you know which page is in (usually 
used in interrupt routines).


Other Unknown Junk -
--------------------

James McKay came through and answered all the unknown junk from the last
version.

The only things I can think of that I would like to know now are:

The data format for the FM chip.

How to play digitized sounds, like in Alex Kidd:  The Lost Stars, and Space
Harrier.  (James did end up giving me a bit of information on this, more just
a theory on how it is done.

Document Informaton -
---------------------

There this thing is ready for publication!!!

Document mostly written by:
        Neon Spiral Injector (cmeadors@stu.ac.cc.md.us)

Super Majik Spiral Crew web site:
        Club Neon - Student (http://stu.ac.cc.md.us/~cmeadors/smsc)

You may use this document any way you wish.  I would like if you mentioned the
SMSC in any derived works, but that is up to you.  Also I would like to see
anything produced using this also be free, but again, I can't control you or
anyone's drive for money.  So this document is placed into the public domain
by the SMSC on 06/21/97.

Oh, and the SMSC can not be held responcible for anything that is done with
this document.  Although we recommend not spending free CPU cycles of a
computer controling an experimental fission reactor playing around with SMS
code.


Thanks for reading!  Now go code something to amaze the world.
